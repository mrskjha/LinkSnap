# URL Shortener

A fast and easy-to-use URL shortening service that lets you shorten long URLs into short, shareable links. Because who likes long URLs anyway?

## Features

- **Shorten URLs:** Quickly shorten any long URL to make it easier to share. Shorter is better!
- **Track URL Usage:** Provides basic tracking of how many times a short URL has been clicked. Let's see who's clicking!
- **Custom Aliases:** Option to customize your shortened URL's alias. Make it snappy, make it catchy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and simple UI for seamless URL shortening. Even your grandma can use it (we hope).
